Memory Engine is an AI chatbot designed to respond in a more thoughtful and expressive way.
Instead of plain answers, it offers quiet, reflective language meant to feel human and emotionally aware.
Ask it something profound, something personal, or something ordinary.
It treats every prompt with the same quiet attention.
